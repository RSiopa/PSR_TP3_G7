I need to put a camera in the back of the robot (priority for now)
Things to change in the code:
The robot will not follow a PoseStamped created by me
create the centroid of the object that he needs to catch (as well as the others)
we need to use the formulas given by the vision classes to change that point to a x,y location 
with that the robot can follow the goal
create arguments to choose manual mode and auto mode
create a mask also for the obstacles (or maybe I only need the Laser scanner for that? Will see)
